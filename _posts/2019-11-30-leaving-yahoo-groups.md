We recently [received the news](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/yahoo-is-deleting-all-content-ever-posted-to-yahoo-groups/) that Yahoo Groups functionality will shortly be [shut down](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN31010.html) and no longer supported by Yahoo. This has led us to migrate our Society's conversations to a new home.

We now have a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robbins-family-society) dedicated to the same valuable conversations we have been conducting on Yahoo Groups. We also have a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/124949990963043/) for those who frequent that social network.

With these two groups, we hope the Society's community will continue to thrive.
